		<p> On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
		<br>Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
		<br>Up ahead in the distance, I saw <font color= "dark yellow">shimmering light </font>
		<br>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
		<br>I had to stop for the night
		<br>There she stood in the doorway;
		<br>I heard the mission bell
		<br>And I was thinking to myself,
		<br>'This could be Heaven or this could be Hell'
		<br>Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
		<br>There were voices down the corridor,
		<br>I thought I heard them say...
		<br> <u> <b> Welcome to the Hotel California
		<br>Such a lovely place </b> </u> </p>
